      Joe Rahaim launched Joe&apos;s Odd Jobs his freshman year of high school.
      As a busy student, volunteer and three sport athlete, a traditional job
      would be difficult given the demands of all three activities. He
      recognized a local niche for handyman services that larger contractors
      wouldn’t be able to fulfill on a timely basis. Joe had access to strong
      and dependable friends and teammates and since late 2014 the business has
      taken off, completing over 1000 jobs across 350 unique customers.
