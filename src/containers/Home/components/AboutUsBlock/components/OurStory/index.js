        Joe Rahaim launched Joe&apos;s Odd Jobs his freshman year of high
        school. As a busy student, volunteer and three sport athlete, a
        traditional job would be difficult given the demands of all three
        activities. He recognized a local niche for handyman services that
        larger contractors wouldnâ€™t be able to fulfill on a timely basis. Joe
        had access to strong and dependable friends and teammates and since late
        2014 the business has taken off, completing over 1000 jobs across 350
        unique customers.
